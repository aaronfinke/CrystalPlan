Abstract = "Analyzing time-of-flight neutron total scattering data involves many
   instrument-dependent corrections, including: detector deadtime,
   normalization of detector counts to beam monitor counts, time-of-flight
   to momentum transfer Q rebinning, use of vanadium (or an equivalent
   standard) data for both calibration and data-merging purposes, as well
   as attenuation, multiple scattering, and inelastic effects. Here we
   review and discuss these methods in the application to data analysis of
   the Glass, Liquid and Amorphous Materials Diffractometer at the Intense
   Pulsed Neutron Source. The implementation in the Integrated Spectra
   Analysis Workbench (ISAW) software suite is discussed in detail.
